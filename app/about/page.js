      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        GetMeAChai is a platform inspired by Patreon — built to help creators,
        developers, and artists receive support directly from their audience.
        It’s like a friendly tip jar, where supporters can buy them a “chai” (or
        several!) to show appreciation for their work.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        I built GetMeAChai as a personal project to understand how platforms like
        Patreon work and to learn more about full-stack web development. My goal
        was to create a simple and transparent way for creators to connect with
        their supporters, without ads, sponsors, or complex setups.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 text-amber-600">My Mission</h2>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        My goal is to empower creators by giving them a clean, easy-to-use
        platform to earn directly from their supporters. Every chai represents
        appreciation, motivation, and trust — and I wanted to make that
        connection effortless.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 text-amber-600">Why I Built It</h2>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        I’ve seen how difficult it can be for small creators to monetize their
        work. Big platforms often take high cuts or hide their content behind
        algorithms. GetMeAChai was built as a learning project and as a tribute
        to independent creators who deserve a fair and simple way to get
        support.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 text-amber-600">Join the Movement</h2>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Whether you’re a creator looking to start your page or a supporter
        wanting to show appreciation, GetMeAChai makes it simple. Create your
        page, share your link, and start receiving support in just minutes.
      </p>
